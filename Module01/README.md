Module description

## Task Inspirations

I've always wanted to make a wifi extender for my parents' place, since the soviet era apartment has awfully thick walls and in some spots of certain rooms you get 0 coverage. I have a couple old routers laying around in a box, but never figured out how to use them for the purpose. Ideally i'd know how to do that after this class.

## Task Personal Profile
Have built some simple systems like a stoplight on a raspberry pi before, taken apart and put together a couple PCs, was part of a robotics class 10 years ago. Other than that not much experience dealing with network protocols or building machines from the ground up. I can follow instructions and probably guess what we're roughly supposed to be doing, and if that doesn't work there's always documentation.
## Task What is IoT

Domains and included areas:
Consumer, Commercial:
  - Wearable products.
  - Smart Home Applications.
Infrastructure:
  - Smart Cities.
  - Health Care.
Industrial:
  - Agriculture and breeding.
  - Industrial Automation.

Commonly used (data) protocols:
- Message Queue Telemetry Transport - Brokers and clients, where brokers share info and clients recieve it
- HyperText Transfer Protocol - Two systems talking to eachother at one time
- Constrained Application Protocol  - Modified HTTP protocol for limited bandwidth or reliability situations

Typical devices (appliance or micro controller):

- ESP32 and ESP8266 for cheaper variants
- Raspberyy Pis for more complex projects with a bigger budget
- Arduino boards for the middle ground

Challenges:
