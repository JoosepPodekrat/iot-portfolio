# Reflection 1 in Module 1

	
The class is going to be mainly making various routers and pieces that connect to those, what their protocols are and how they work, making simple software for the things. The  lectures and labs are going to be connected, so skipping them is suboptimal. Connectivity pieces like the dallas temperature sensor are all comically cheap.
Using the tiny thumb drives that change everyone's screen color was pretty neat, they're really easy to use and explained the brokering system very well. The buddy system worked out relatively well, didn't seem like most people were having trouble.
We had some trouble following the teacher's guidance,  likely because we weren't given the correct pieces at first and then got stuck on a step for a minute while they moved on.
We had some trouble putting together the temperature sensor because we had none of the pieces, but after a bit of confusion we figured out the trick to fixing that was just asking for some. Then we wired the thing wrong and couldn't figure out why it wasn't working because we also had the code configured so that the wrong button was sending the signal. Double checked the wiring and fixed the code with the teacher's help. One of the groups in the front seemed to have a language/cultural problem at first, but they seemed to get along decently enough at the end. If they're still having trouble, can help them out in the group section.
Instructors and peers were both nice enough, the group sitting right in front of us were helpful other than constantly changing our background color. Instructors came over relatively quickly to help with any issues and seemed smart. 
Help and extra work
Me and my teammate both worked together well, bounced some ideas between each other and knew different things, so it ended up working well. 
Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself? - not particularly
