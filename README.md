# Personal Portfolio for the IoT class at University of tartu

> Start with module 1: have a small log (keywords are fine, we appreciate sentences, but can read keywords quicker as you usually have to present your tasks to an instructor this is more a help for yourself than for us) and pictures from class and lab tasks in here. 
> Any code goes into git repo (needs to be linked in portfolio). If you use example codes without changes, you can also link to it.
