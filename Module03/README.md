## Intranet
Intranets are a limited access network, usually for heightened security, where only a limited group of people can access it. More private than the internet. Access in and out goes through gateways (routers), making it easier to control what information enters and leaves. Some sites and IPs might be blocked from taking part.
Less vulnerable to malicious attacks and more private from outsiders, but easier to trace actions within the system due to needing a verified or physical connection to the network. Usually hosted by the users themselves, and thus not affected as much by outages in the internet infrastructure. Easier to maintain and has a lower latency.
##Internet
Publicly accessible  and connected to the whole world. 
## Router roleplay
LARPed a wifi network with a couple clients, MQTT protocol. A lot of data got lost in traffic and it was comically slow.
