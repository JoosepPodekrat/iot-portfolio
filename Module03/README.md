## Module 3
Intranets are a limited access network, usually for heightened security, where only a limited group of people can access it. More private than the internet. Access in and out goes through gateways (routers), making it easier to control what information enters and leaves. Some sites and IPs might be blocked from taking part.
Less vulnerable to malicious attacks and more private from outsiders, but easier to trace actions within the system due to needing a verified or physical connection to the network. Usually hosted by the users themselves, and thus not affected as much by outages in the internet infrastructure. Easier to maintain and has a lower latency.
## Internet
Publicly accessible  and connected to the whole world. 
## Router roleplay
LARPed a wifi network with a couple clients, MQTT protocol. A lot of data got lost in traffic and it was comically slow.

# We are going to show here notes for Task 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to prove

# Week1
Lecture
MQTT: The standard for IoT Messaging. Router is made of - computer and networking device.

# intranet vs deploying a system on internet
Exclusion of of accsess from outsiders. Intranet is safer and used for internal communication like delivering tools. Connected to gateways/ROUTER. Internet is accessible to everyone and reachable, used for e-commerce, websites and so on.

# Task
How to make a network using a router:

Connect, router with ethernet cable to the computer. Log into the router. Install the MosQuiTTO tools. Configure MQTT listener for listening. Connect your phone with the network. Donwload MyMQTT, log in listener details and create a topic to send messages. All done.

# Task First Aid button
Made a IOT network, that was connected to esp8266, and computer. Because we had a broken power splitter, then we couldn't use our phone with usb port to tether the internet. So we used our phones hotspot named Vork, made the router repat it (the repeat mini project) and sent the messages with that network.

Reflection 3
We had a lot of trouble getting the router set up properly working, but the solution was right at the beginning of the task so just starting from 0 fixed the issue.
